# A minimal playground boilerplate

> **Note** Not intended for production!

This is an extremely minimalistic starter boilerplate intended to be used as a playground which supports es6 and react.
Most of the times a [react jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/) or [codepen](http://codepen.io/everdimension/pen/pyOyrx) will be enough.

But sometimes you wish to have a little more control or be able to freely add/remove npm modules, and fiddles are not enough.

* No production configuration
* No unnecessary files
* Minimum dependencies just to have es6 and react working

### How to use

1. Clone project

        git clone -o react-minimal-boilerplate git@github.com:everdimension/react-minimal-boilerplate.git
